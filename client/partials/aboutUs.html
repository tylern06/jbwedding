						<h4>His Story</h4>
							<p>
								Joshua Emory Bradburn​
							</p>
							<p>
								I was born in Misawa, Japan and raised in Okinawa. I love the fact that I can call myself a military brat - Not only to acknowledge my families' support of our great country, but to also say I have been places and done those things. I grew up like all little boys, loving to play sports and games. Traveling back and forth to Seattle, Las Vegas, and Spokane were routine trips when we were kids. That was the only taste of the states I had. In retrospect, those are now my two favorite things in the world, right after Belinda of course, sports and traveling! We moved to the States, to Seattle, in 1997. A whole new world... Like all new things, getting used to Seattle and calling it home was difficult. Finding friends and settling in ultimately helped him and the fam opening up to calling it home. In time I have learned to call Washington home, and loving the experience and people. I think the best part of being in WA, and not in the military and on an island, is that I have still those friends around me then today.

						<h4>Her Story</h4>
						<p>
							Belinda Phan Nghiem
						</p>
						<p>
							Unlike Josh, I was born and raised in Seattle and graduated from UW. GO HUSKIES!! Although I didn't grow up abroad, it certainly felt like it. Since my father's entire family lives in Vietnam, he made it a priority for me to visit them with every spare moment I had. I went back almost every other summer and never wanted to come back (Seattle). I believe that traveling as child fostered my love to explore new places and I hope that Josh and I can fill up our passports before it expires. Along with traveling, I love to eat, outdoor activities, spend time with family and friends, but really up for anything new and exciting. Right now, I am taking courses in preparation for applying to PA or ARNP programs and preparing for what is in stored for me as Mrs. Joshua Bradburn!

							As the sun rose and as we left our apartment, what seem to be just another dreadful Monday became one of the most memorable day in their lives. Like usual, their day consist of back and forth text and the biggest topic of the day, what's for dinner! They realized they didn't have any groceries at home, so Josh offered to pick Belinda up after work and they'd go grab dinner somewhere at Uvillage. They decided on Chipotle and after dinner, they decided to walk around Uvillage to digest and soak up the gorgeous sunny day Seattle was having. As they were walking around, they quickly realized that Bruno, their dog, was home alone and hasn’t been fed or taken out yet, so they rushed home. Once parked, they grabbed all of their belongings, but Belinda noticed that Josh had left his backpack behind. She told him he should bring it upstairs but he insisted that it will be fine in the car, even though our car got semi broken into earlier that week. As we walked into the apartment, Belinda noticed that their bedroom door was wide open and the bathroom door was completely shut. She immediately thought that someone came into their home and rummaged through their things. Belinda went on a little rampage as Josh tried to persuade her that no one was in the apartment and she was the one who forgot to close the bedroom door and closed the bathroom door (she ALWAYS remember before she heads out of the apartment). Anyhow, Josh brushed it off and told her she can worry about it later and we had to take Bruno out. She agreed and they left. When they got to the lobby, Josh noted that Belinda was right and he shouldn’t have left his backpack in the car. He said he will be right back and ran to the car. Finally, after getting his backpack, they started to walk towards a nearby park. Once at the park, they let Bruno off his leash and roam the area. As he was running around, Josh said he had a surprise for Belinda and out of his backpack; he pulled out their adventure book. He said that he knew it's been awhile since we've added to their book so he took the liberty to add to it. He handed the book over and said "read it, read it." So she did, silently. He said, "Can you please read it aloud." The note that Josh wrote to Belinda was the sweetest. It mentioned how much he care, love, adore her and he is excited for what the future has in stored for them. After the note, he added photos of their adventures together for the past 3.5 years to show that although they haven’t added to their book, the adventures live on. Belinda then turns to the last page and Josh suddenly got so awkward, nervous, emotional that as he tried to stand up and kneel down on one knee, but instead falls over and plopped to the ground. Belinda, confused and worried,  said "Josh are you okay, what's wrong?" Josh could barely annunciate Belinda’s name then she looked closely at the last picture in the book and it was a photo of an engagement ring! At this point, Belinda is so shocked everything after was a blur. Josh said some words that in Belinda’s head was blah blah my heart blah blah my world blah blah marry me. She immediately said nooo! Are you sure?! Can we take this back and do this all over again. Belinda being materialistic, wanted to look nicer than her everyday sweaty messy self. Josh giggled and said “Yes, I am sure and you look beautiful baby!” Belinda grabbed josh's face and kissed him and said she loves him so much. Then josh said welll...patiently waiting for an answer here. She laughed and said DUHHH! Of course! They hugged and kissed as mosquitoes where biting them!! ​
