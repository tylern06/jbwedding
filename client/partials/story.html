							​We will never forget the day we met! Well, we actually met a time before this, but Belinda's memory has seemed a little hazy meeting each other at Nintendo, while Josh and his boys were playing basketball and she was visiting with Shuk. But the real date, when the stars were aligned, was February 3rd of 2012. Daniel and Shuk had decided to host a Super Bowl party and ironically both of them decided to bring wings as their potluck item. Josh loves wings, if you didn't know, and Belinda is known for making her wings... Let's just say Belinda's first impression of Josh wasn't great. This guy was stealing her shine! Josh will never forget what she wore that day - White T-shirt and a pink bra, the go to outfit! I would say that was the bulk of the excitement of their introduction; arguing over wings the first 10 minutes and watching the game - or trying to, at least. After enjoying all of the food that everyone had brought that day, it was time to claim seats/area to watch the game. Belinda was sitting on the couch with the girls and Josh had strategically sat on the ground, in front of her, placing his big head in Belinda's way. His head was so ginormous that she couldn’t but notice him. We would like to tell you more of what happened that night, but Josh being the shy type, putting his head in the way was his move to get noticed. Later that evening after we both got home from the game, Josh texted Daniel and Shuk to ask for Belinda's number, even though they barely said a word to each other the ENTIRE night. LOL This turned out to be just his style, awkward and weird! From there we could say is history!
